This folder contains code to do some simple exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the processed/cleaned data.
The code produces a few tables and figures, which are saved in the appropriate `results` sub-folder.

1. Population distribution according to gender, age and obesity level.
2. Relationship between obesity level and gender.
3. Age distribution indicates it won't make sense to be included as a predictor.
4. Relationship between obesity level and family history.
